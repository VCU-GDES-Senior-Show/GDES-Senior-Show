projectDesc: |
    In order to expand the idea of what sewing and stitching can be used for I wanted to experiment with mark-making. I wanted the outcome of my mark-making to be a documentation of my daily emotions.
    
    I did this by dying 12 fabric 8in x 8in squares and documenting my daily emotions with a tallying method. Firstly, the shapes made by dye will inform where I sow. And Secondly, my emotions will inform what color thread I use to sow.
