    Local Eats is a foldable brochure that acts as a restaurant guide for some of the most popular spots in Scott's Addition. It features eleven different restaurants and descriptions, a map, a small tour or day plan including the aforementioned restaurants, a brief history of the area, and a keepsake poster. The guide is meant to act as something that can serve as short term tool but can also be kept as memorabilia. This self guided food tour and restaurant guide is meant to help people discover some of the amazing food Richmond has to offer.
