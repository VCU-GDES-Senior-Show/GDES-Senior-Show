    Signs of Our Times is a risograph printed booklet that explores and shares more knowledge on Filipino sign painting to bring more recognition to the practice. Historically, this subject has been overlooked despite its importance in expressing the Filipino cultural identity. The booklet goes through the unique qualities and styles of Filipino sign painting, while also showcasing the process of immersing myself in the practices of Filipino sign painters. Through research and exercise, the book documents my development in learning the different techniques and styles incorporated in this discipline. In displaying this course of learning, I want to demonstrate a critical commitment to the exploration of Filipino graphic design.
