projectName: Crafting the Empress
projectDesc: |
    This project is an exploration of craft and femininity using The Empress tarot card. Each piece takes several hours to produce, most of which can only be done by hand. As part of my journey there has been lots of trial and error that normally does not get seen or acknowledged. I wanted to show “the back” of each piece to normalize this part of the process as well as the tools and skills required for each creation. Some pieces are left unfinished to comment on the time commitment of the various craft forms while still having enough context to understand what the final would look like.
