projectName: Paper Immortelle
projectDesc: |
    Paper Immortelle is a photobook which compares the metaphorical journey of life to folding paper. It features documentation of the messy process of creating a single, large scale origami rose folded throughout the city of Richmond, Virginia. The creases as well as the unintentional marks represent my choices and their effects which have permanently impacted the experience of my time in Richmond. However, the completion of the rose represents the idea that while the experience I've had here is set in stone, the "Richmond" chapter of my life is ending and the next is soon beginning.
