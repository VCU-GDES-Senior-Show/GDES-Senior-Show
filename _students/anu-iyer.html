    Sektari is a retro video game reminiscent of the 32-bit style generation of games pulling inspiration from the Metroidvania genre. The story is of an astronaut that has crash landed on a planet and received hope of finding a way back home. In a long dangerous mission, players can run through a section of this journey and get a preview of fighting arthropod-like alien enemies and exploring the underground cave planet of Sektari.
    The creation of Sektari was highly iterative and made through the collaboration of multiple peers. The team responsible for the creation of Sektari is the art director and main artist, Anu Iyer, the background and concept artist, Bharathi Mathivanan, the developer, Ashok Subedi, and the background score, Jordan Reinecke.
