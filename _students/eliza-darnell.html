projectName: "Self-Destruction & Rebirth"
projectDesc: |
    ‘Self-Destruction & Rebirth’ follows the process of deconstructing and transforming my old clothes into vessels for holding flowers. These textiles were transformed through methods of dye removal, natural dyeing by flowers, patchworking, and braiding. Through this process of destroying and manipulating these items belonging to my past self, I thought a lot about the impermanent nature of life and the duality of destruction and renewal within the act of change. These vessels became a metaphor for the changes I’ve experienced as a human being, juxtaposed with flowers that also undergo their own cycle of changes in life.
