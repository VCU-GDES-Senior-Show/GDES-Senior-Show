    Fractal Sense is a camera filter tool used to distort live image and respond to audio at different levels. First created as part of a daily coding practice, Fractal Sense branched off into an exploration of its own. The filter consists of fractals. When adding sound, the triangles produce smaller ones of the same proportion. This is a phenomenon that also occurs in the natural world. The book spreads featured on the website includes still images from footage collected with the tool in Bryant Park while my laptop sat overheating on a large rock.
