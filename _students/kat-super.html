projectDesc: |
    Closure Cards is a project that resists the human desire to conceal or twist what we really wish to say to others. We try to mask the ‘not so pretty’ words with smiley faces and cute little puns. We send or give greeting cards to loved ones in order to keep appearances or as a desperate attempt for validation. But what do we really want to say? What would you say if there was no chance for them to respond? and to whom would you say it?
