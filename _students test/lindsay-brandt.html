projectName: Dynagraphie: Notes on Choreography
projectDesc: |
    Dynagraphie: Notes on Choreography, is a publication created to archive the process of developing a system of choreographic notation based on the practice of movement mapping. Dancers comprehend movement beyond just its basic forms, rather housing ideas in combinations and longer phrases. The structure of Dynagraphie focuses on the visualization of the expressive qualities of movement and works to communicate the dynamic elements within dance. This system is intended as a teaching tool to encourage dancers to get involved in natural movement discovery and as a choreographic tool to mark dynamic elements in a completed choreography.

     Dyangraphie: Notes on Choreography is comprised of two parts; a written analysis of the creative process and instructions for the system of recording movement with a collection of final compositions. The book is bound in a dos-Ã -dos to bring the two sections together mirroring the connection between the process and its unique execution.
