projectDesc: |
    "Evolution" will show ten movie posters that represent the evolution of movie poster design in the United States, starting from the 1030s to the 2020s, while each poster will portray one decade. This project aims to explore new ways movie posters can be made, like involving 3-D glasses to add a fun aspect for the viewer. The reason I decided to make this is that I love movies. Adding to that, posters were one of the many reasons why I pursued graphic design as a career.
