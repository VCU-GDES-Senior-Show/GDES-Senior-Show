    My zine is a collection of some of the things I've eaten over the timespan of a month. It includes aspects of pre-existing magazines while omitting the parts that I don't like. The content shows the extent of my comfortability in regards to sharing about myself/my life. As a foodie, this project was fun to work on and allowed me to kill two birds with one stone.
