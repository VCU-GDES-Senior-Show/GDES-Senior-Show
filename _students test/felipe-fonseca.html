    Pendiente is a video/sound piece that I shot, directed, and composed. Pendiente visualizes and brings to light my personal experience with anxiety, as well as my journey producing electronic dance music. Formally, the video emulates the interface of a synthesizer, the machines I use to produce music with. The clips used in the video are mostly frames reenacting nervous tics I notice in myself whenever I feel anxious. The typography appearing in the video also visualizes nervous tics, while drawing the comparison of a sleepless anxiety filled night and a rave environment.
