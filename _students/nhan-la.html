projectDesc: |
    Growing up as a third culture kid (TCK), being a Chinese-Vietnamese person in the United States, I was a â€˜citizen of everywhere and nowhere.' As a consequence of this mishmash of different identities and cultures that I have adapted, it has created this sort of complexity that I want to express in this project: that sense of being a bit of everything, yet not truly belonging to one community. That sense of universality. The answer to that is something I love which is tea. Hence, KIT-TEA was created as a collection of six miniature instructional booklets on how to brew a perfect cup of tea and as an expression of myself.
