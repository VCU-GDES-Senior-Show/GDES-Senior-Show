projectName: New Symbol for Dream Representation
projectDesc: |
    "Is there a creative way to log and visualize the dream for everyone?" A dream calendar that helps users visualize their dreams by attaching stickers that represent each designated emotion. The way users attach the stickers on the calendar will create a unique symbol of their dream for each month. I was thinking of what element I can use for creating the dream calendar, and the emotion came up into my mind. When I wake up from the dream, the story isn't very lasting from the memory but the feeling of the dream is long lasting. And to develop the emotion in design wise, I wanted to work on the relationship between emotion and color. The stickers in different colors represent different emotions.
