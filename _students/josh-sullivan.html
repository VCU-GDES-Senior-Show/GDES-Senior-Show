projectDesc: |
    HighLow™ is a graphic t-shirt and apparel brand that I developed to counteract fast fashion through high quality, wearable designs printed on low impact materials. HighLow™ is grounded in the authenticity of the individual, so each shirt is crafted using secondhand materials and a hands-on screen-printing process to create true one-of-a-kind tees. In embracing the unexpected moments between preexisting designs and my new designs, HighLow™ elevates creative self-expression and breathes new life into thrifted clothing. Endure the low to experience the high, take care–with love.
