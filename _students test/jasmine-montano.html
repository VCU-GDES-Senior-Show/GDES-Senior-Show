    This project showcases my memories from a few places I grew up in in the form of album covers. I have lived in 7 states and 1 other country besides the U.S., and one of the ways I kept track of where I have been is through the songs that played in the background while I did routine things in my life. My intentions with this project were to get more personal with my work and experiment with the form of an album case as opposed to a traditional jewel case. In addition to the visuals of the case I have designed, I included a storytelling aspect for each memory in the audio.
