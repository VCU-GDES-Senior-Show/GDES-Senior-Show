    The myth of Prometheus can be read as a metaphor for the psychological mechanism of the modern meritocratic subject (Leistungssubjekt), that is, to inflict violence on itself and wage war against itself.
    A eagle pecks his liver daily, which keeps growing again, and this vicious eagle is his alter ego, constantly fighting against himself.
    Prometheus as a self-exploitative subject is seized by a never-ending sense of weariness. He is the original metaphor of the Müdigkeitsgesellschaft (The burnout society).
    "The gods are tired, the eagle is tired, the wound is healed in weariness."
    — Franz Kafka
