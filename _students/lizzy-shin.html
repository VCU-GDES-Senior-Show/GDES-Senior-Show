    For my project, I wanted to show my unique cultural identity through an eclectic mix of diverse experiences and styles. I was born and raised in Korea and immigrated to the U.S. when I was young. As I became adapted to American culture, I started to slowly feel disconnected from my Korean heritage in my daily life. This inspired me not only to explore and make work on my cultural background of both countries but also to find a way to tie up moments both Eastern and Western perspectives have shown me and present them into one. From this, I designed a visual typeface using a mixture of both countries' alphabets, Hangul and English. Each letter was then combined and designed into diverse forms using cultural elements of patterns, objects, and places that were personally memorable, belonging, and meaningful to me when I lived in the U.S. and Korea.
