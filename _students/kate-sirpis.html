projectName: The Curated Creative
projectDesc: |
    The Curated Creative is a catalog dedicated to my lifelong infatuation with crafting. Over the past two years, my bedroom in Richmond has become a creative space for myself and several others. Friends knew that my room had the materials they needed for a project and they knew that they could find me in it, probably crafting, ready for whatever project they had. In an attempt to reduce my collection of craft supplies before graduation, Iâ€™ve spent this last semester of college exploring my capabilities and experimenting with numerous craft techniques to create a collection of items that reflect the creativity that has taken place in my bedroom.
