    Memories Trapped in Lines is a handmade screw-post bound archival book of my family letters from 2016 to the present. This book will keep all the scanned version of the letters scattered in places like memory boxes, emails, and phone albums in one place. Since these letters are the primary communication between the family members, lines are filled with life updates and feelings of longing. I hope this book will serve as a historic family piece that weâ€™ll look back to and remember everything we have been through.
