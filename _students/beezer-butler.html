projectDesc: |
    Vivisect is focused on experimentally pulling apart preexisting typefaces and recreating new figures. Panels were created by drawing from preexisting digital typography and breaking down its uniformity through hand done processes, turning them back into letter forms. 
    Through this dissection there is an attempt to create a more human based letter,  encouraging play and embracing the imperfections that come along with hand drawing letter forms. These hand drawn forms are further pulled apart into the individual pieces and parts that make up a letterâ€™s anatomy. These smaller still semi-recognizable pieces then create and take on new forms.
