    My project is a sculpture that bridges the theme of the body with the silhouettes of the different parts of a sneaker. I intended for my sneaker to be seen as a metaphor for a "body" in a way that its appendages resemble the form of organic body parts or that it can carry out and serve actual functions. Instead of limiting the unique and interesting structures within the sneaker by catergorizing it as apparel, I wanted to highlight certain parts of a shoe that might've gotten overlooked or not paid attention to. I dissected different sections from various sneakers and combined those fragments to form a sneaker conglomerate.
