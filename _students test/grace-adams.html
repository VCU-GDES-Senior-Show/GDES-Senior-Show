    This is a body of work that visually represents the 10 cognitive distortions identified in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. I reorganized and reframed the information in a more appealing, accessible way in hopes of reaching a larger audience. The body of work consists of 10, 11” by 17”, posters and a 40 page booklet. Each poster is a visual representation and reinterpretation of the cognitive distortions identified in the book. My writing was formulated from my research and personal experience with negative thoughts. This book serves as a tool to help direct and guide individuals to identifying unhelpful thinking patterns in their own life as well as provide tools to reframe and cope with negative thoughts and feelings.
