projectName: An Exploration of Natural Patterns
projectDesc: |
    An Exploration of Natural Patterns dives deeper into an ongoing unconscious practice. Over the years Iâ€™ve documented numerous natural patterns and found that as a starting point to a greater practice. Realizing this, I expanded this exploration of pattern and experimented with different materials and practices. My intuition and materials guided me through this process. I played with print making, laser etching, scanning and distortions, digital pattern making, and compiled some of these techniques into a mixed media piece.
