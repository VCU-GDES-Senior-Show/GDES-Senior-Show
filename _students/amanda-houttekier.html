projectName: Acanthus Display Typeface
projectDesc: |
    Acanthus Display is a serif typeface inspired by the decorative motifs and principles of ornamentation in Baroque architecture. One of the most prominently featured plants used in foliage adornment, Acanthus leaves have been utilized through the ages for interior and exterior architectural elements. Pulling from the theatric and ornate art style, this typeface bends the rules to add decoration to the page through nested ligatures and alternates with dramatic swashes. Containing 129 glyphs, 40 Ligatures, and 11 alternate characters, Acanthus Display is available to download on Behance (@amanda-houttekier).
