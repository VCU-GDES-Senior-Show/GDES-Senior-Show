projectDesc: |
    The Outlaws is a short animation about a group of bandits who journey through multiple dimensions. Initially, the animation will start with the chosen family in prison after a failed bank heist. Soon you'll see them travel through a 3d portal, and they'll even be exposed to human interaction. Keep in mind that in every portal they enter, their appearances morph. I've always been interested in the world of cartoons and world-building. Already knowing how to make a 2d animation, I was apprehensive about using the program Blender. Since this is my first time making anything in the 3d aspect, I'm very proud of how this turned out. I can't wait to see what's in store for my future. Oh, and p.s. Watch out for these guys because they're bad news!
