    A way of showing myself love and reclaiming a positive outlook on mental health and the dark thoughts I have felt from Jan ‘22 to Dec ‘22. Using cross-stitch, crochet, and tapestry beading, each piece is dedicated to a specific point of the year and tells a story of an avoidance of home, a feeling of oneself being out of their own body, and rethinking certain important relationships and aspects about my life that I used to feel so confident and sure about. This story will be told in a semi abstract way; to give context I will also have journal entries paired with these pieces all handwritten and placed next to each piece.
