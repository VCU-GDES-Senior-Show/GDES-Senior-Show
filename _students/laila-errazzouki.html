projectDesc: |
    This piece is an exploration of the role of women in Morocco as messengers. Through generations of storytellers, women within the Moroccan home open portals to other worlds and transcend the very barriers, limitations, and divisions put in place by the patriarchy. Through their memories and imagination, they are preservers of ancient history, culture, tradition, and beliefs. This work aims to join the documentary with the imaginary, blurring the lines between both dimensions and ultimately creating an entirely new whole.
