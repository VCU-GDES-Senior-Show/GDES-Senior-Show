projectName: Brushing up On Lost Art
projectDesc: |
    My project explores why we feel the need to preserve art and what do we lose when we don't? the book delves into topics such as: how we decide what art is preserved, examples of art that has been lost or rediscovered, and the incredible lengths we go to to preserve art that may have been intended to be impermanent.
