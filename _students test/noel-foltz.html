projectName: Mystical Melodies
projectDesc: |
    Mystical Melodies is a 40-card oracle deck that is divided into 5 suits – mantras, encouragement, inspiration, wisdom, & reflection. This deck is very special to me as it combines many of my passions – art, design, oracle readings, & music. I hope when these cards are used, the reader too will create deep connections with them. This deck is a mystical tool that is intended to support people on their path to Universal guidance. Each card has a special message that is meant to inspire people to make positive choices and offer opportunities for reflection in their life.
