    Since January I have been researching the history of mail art and using that knowledge to investigate the significance of physical correspondence in the presence of the internet. The work presented here represents the beginning of an ongoing mail art practice, starting with a focus on the format of receipt printing. In some ways the mail art movement of the 1960s, 70s and 80s predicted the creative climate of the internetâ€”as Fluxus artist Robert Filliou called it, the "Eternal Network." Influencing each other and being together, but not in the same physical space, being in all places at once. By printing text, images, websites on receipt paper, the language format-shifts numerous times before even reaching its recipient. In this way I think what someone has to say feels more significant: when the distance through realms it has traveled can be felt.
