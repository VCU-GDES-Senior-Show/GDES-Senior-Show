projectName: What Is Love (Actually)?
projectDesc: |
    Love is said to be one of the most important yet least understood of human emotions due to its many complexities. Influenced by both biology and culture, the way in which we each express and experience love is majorly impacted by personal conceptions about the subject. This can be influenced by factors like your upbringing, the media you engage with, or even the experiences of those you care about. In order to understand how most opinions about love may vary, this website is built around an archive of survey responses that allow the viewer to observe how their own perception of love may relate or differ from someone else. So what is love to you?
